Value = Negative Interest
  After [spending time], VillageCoins will start to depriciate in value at rate of [time depreciation].
Value = Generated by by All Living Humans
  Any living human can sign up to access VillageCoin through [ID Verificatin Process]. Once they sign up, they will begin receiving VillageCoins. Every [Verification Time] they will need to [Verify Aliveness]. All VillageCoins will vanish for a user who has not [Verified Aliveness], or who has reached [max age].
Value = Constant Distribtion 
  As long as you exist, the coin will keep flowing at [distro rate]. Rate should be set to match basic cost of living.
Value = Localization
  Coin's value drops when [transation location] is more than [spending distance limit] away from user's [village address], at the rate of [distance depreciation]. [Village address] can only be changed once every [village address change limit]. Override offered for [non-local rent] in cases in which landlord is not locally based. 
  
 EXAMPLE:
 
   [spending time] = 2 years
   [time depreciation] = 2.1% each year 
   [ID verification process] = Process that verifies one account per user. Consider forking this system: www.securepollingsystem.org (https://github.com/securepollingsystem)
   [verify aliveness] = process that verifies user is alive.
   [max age = 120 years]
   [distro rate] = set distribution of VillageCoins to match [present offical cost of living] in user's region, dispersment rate of VillageCoins to match current [value of local currency in user's region] (help encourage venders to match prices 1-for-1 to local currancy rates).   
   [spending distance limit] = 40km
   [village address] = GPS cordinants of the location where user most often spends money to meet their basic needs (for rule people, this might be far from where they live; that is okay!)
   [village address change limit] = 1 time every 2 months
   [village address change limit application] = process through which someone can verify they are nomadic, and be allowed exception. 
   [distance depreciation] = -.01% for each km away from user's [village address].
   [non-local rent] = process to allow tenants who pay rent to landlords located far from [village address] to bypass [distance depriciation] for this transaction.
