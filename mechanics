CommonsCash (VillageCoin)

Paradigm = Generated Equally by by All Living Humans
  Version 2.0 - Villagecoins will be assigned to every living human through [ID Verificatin Process]. Once they sign up, they will begin receiving VillageCoins at [distro rate] until 120 years after their birth. Coins will continue to dispense whether or not they [Verify Aliveness]. Upon the death of a user, their remaining  alotment [distro rate until (birth day + 120 years)] may be redirected to a person(s) of their choice via their last will and testiment. 
  Version 1.0 - Any living human can sign up to access VillageCoin through [ID Verificatin Process]. Once they sign up, they will begin receiving VillageCoins. Every [Verification Time] they will need to [Verify Aliveness]. All VillageCoins will vanish for a user who has not [Verified Aliveness], or who has reached [max age].

Paradigm = Constant Distribtion 
  The coin will keep flowing at [distro rate]. Rate should be set to match basic cost of living.
  Since VillageCoins are generated by being alive, there is no need for blockchain.

Paradigm = Negative Interest (Time-based Depreciation)
  After [time limit], VillageCoins will depriciate in value at rate of [time depreciation]. Much like fruit and veggies spoil if left uneaten, your VillageCoin will depriciate if left unused.

Paradigm = Localization (Distance-based Depreciation)
  Coin's value drops when [transation location] is more than [spending distance limit] away from user's [village address], at the rate of [distance depreciation]. [Village address] can only be changed once every [village address change limit]. Override offered for [non-local rent] in cases in which landlord is not locally based. 

Paradigm = Ecological Reflexivity 
  Ecoloigical budgets are built into the system.
  Version 1.0 Every user also gets [fixed amount of eco-tokens]. Every person in the system has the same number of eco-tokens they can invest. These tokens direct funds towards Eco-Agencies that handle different anthropogenic ecological problems (Carbon emissions, ocean acidification, ocean nutrient pollution, aquifer sustainability, etc). The funds generated by each eco-token can be used to obtain supplies, tools, services, labor, etc by the Eco-Agency. Also, a presentage of the funds generated by the ecotokens go towards the approved eco-budgeting commission(s) that monitior the anthropogenic budgets that relate to that eco-entity (for example, carbon budgeting, water-nutrient budgeting, etc). Eco-agencies are a new type of entity--not quite NGOs, and not quite publicly traded companies. A group of scientists might come together to create a new eco-agency to address some new ecological need or to try some novel tactic at addressing an ecological problem (much like popping an IPO on the stock market) and will work to gain reputable endorsements that help movtivate eco-vestors to direct their eco-vestment tokens towards their project. For example, perhaps Joan is very concerned about HABs (Hazardous Algal Blooms), so she moves her eco-vestment tokens to support 10 eco-angencies that she thinks are addressing HADs in a helpful way. At the end of the financial quarter, the eco-budgeting commission will use assessments to calculate the degree to which the eco-agencies she invested her tokens in made a positive [impact]. If they did make a positive impact, she gets a [return]. Additionally, if the project she supported has staggered benefits, she will recieve benefits in the future according to [benefits rate].
  
Paradign = Decentralized Ledger 
  A distributed ledger system will be used to keep tally of coins, with the aim to eliminate the oversight by centralized entities. 
  
 EXAMPLE:
 
   [time limit] = 2 years
   [time depreciation] = 2.1% each year following [time limit]
   [ID verification process] = Process that verifies one account per user. --> Consider forking this system: www.securepollingsystem.org (https://github.com/securepollingsystem)
   [verify aliveness] = process that verifies user is alive.
   [max age] = 120 years
   [distro rate] = set distribution of VillageCoins to match [present estimated cost of living in user's region], dispersment rate of VillageCoins to match [present value of local currency in user's region] (this helps encourage venders to match prices 1-for-1 to local currancy rates).   
   [spending distance limit] = 40km
   [village address] = GPS cordinants of the location where user most often spends money to meet their basic needs (for rural people, this might be far from where they live, but that is okay!)
   [village address change limit] = 1 time every 2 months
   [village address change limit application] = process through which someone can verify they travel, and are allowed change village address a few more times per year. 
   [distance depreciation] = -.01% for each km away from user's [village address]. (if spend 500 km away from home, value is 50%. If spent 1000km from home or further, value is 0).
   [non-local rent] = process to allow tenants who pay rent to landlords located far from [village address] to bypass [distance depriciation] for this transaction only.
   [fixed amount of eco-tokens] = 250. This seems close to the human capcity for keeping track of things (see: Pokemon gameplay styles). 
   [impact] = numerical assessment of ecological harm reduction, ecological wealth expansion, and other metrics in relaction to a specific [eco-budget].
   [eco-budget] = Eco-budgets are generated by non-partisan commissionst that access each [ecological harm system] on the market.
   [ecological harm system] = Each form of ecological harm is treated as a unique system, with its own set of metrics that contribute to its eco-budget. Examples include anthropogenic, harful algal blooms (HABs), ocean acidificaiton, aquifer compaction, etc.
   [return] = a boost in rate of recieving CommonsCash (VillageCoin), a boost in number of Eco-vestment Tokens, and a set of "travel tokens" in which the localization paradigm has been suspended, allowing the user to spend them anywhere.
   [benefits rate] = rate determined by eco-budgeting commission to correspond with rates of ecological wealth generation over time (for example, if a user invests in an eco-agency with benefits that don't begin to emerge until 10 years later).
