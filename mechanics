Value = Negative Interest (Time-based Depreciation)
  After [time limit], VillageCoins will depriciate in value at rate of [time depreciation].
Value = Generated by by All Living Humans
  Any living human can sign up to access VillageCoin through [ID Verificatin Process]. Once they sign up, they will begin receiving VillageCoins. Every [Verification Time] they will need to [Verify Aliveness]. All VillageCoins will vanish for a user who has not [Verified Aliveness], or who has reached [max age].
Value = Constant Distribtion 
  As long as you exist, the coin will keep flowing at [distro rate]. Rate should be set to match basic cost of living.
Value = Localization (Distance-based Depreciation)
  Coin's value drops when [transation location] is more than [spending distance limit] away from user's [village address], at the rate of [distance depreciation]. [Village address] can only be changed once every [village address change limit]. Override offered for [non-local rent] in cases in which landlord is not locally based. 
  
 EXAMPLE:
 
   [time limit] = 2 years
   [time depreciation] = 2.1% each year following [time limit]
   [ID verification process] = Process that verifies one account per user. --> Consider forking this system: www.securepollingsystem.org (https://github.com/securepollingsystem)
   [verify aliveness] = process that verifies user is alive.
   [max age] = 120 years
   [distro rate] = set distribution of VillageCoins to match [present estimated cost of living in user's region], dispersment rate of VillageCoins to match [present value of local currency in user's region] (this helps encourage venders to match prices 1-for-1 to local currancy rates).   
   [spending distance limit] = 40km
   [village address] = GPS cordinants of the location where user most often spends money to meet their basic needs (for rural people, this might be far from where they live, but that is okay!)
   [village address change limit] = 1 time every 2 months
   [village address change limit application] = process through which someone can verify they travel, and are allowed change village address a few more times per year. 
   [distance depreciation] = -.01% for each km away from user's [village address]. (if spend 500 km away from home, value is 50%. If spent 1000km from home or further, value is 0).
   [non-local rent] = process to allow tenants who pay rent to landlords located far from [village address] to bypass [distance depriciation] for this transaction only.
